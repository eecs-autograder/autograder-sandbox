# Autograder Sandbox

This Python library uses Docker container functionality to create a secure, isolated environment for running untrusted code.
Full API documentation can be found at http://autograder-sandbox.readthedocs.io

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.6
- Docker >= 1.10

## Installation
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
1. Install this library with pip: `pip install autograder-sandbox`
The first time you start a sandbox (using a context manager), the appropriate Docker image will be downloaded automatically.

## Configuration
### Docker Image
The Docker image used by default is [jameslp/ag-ubuntu-16:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/jameslp/ag-ubuntu-16/).

Supported base images:
- jameslp/ag-ubuntu-16:latest
- jameslp/ag-ubuntu-16:1

If using a custom image, begin your custom Dockerfile with `FROM {base image}`, replacing `{base image}` with an image from the above list. Then, when creating an AutograderSandbox instance, pass the name of your custom image as the `docker_image` parameter. Alternatively, you can set the SANDBOX_DOCKER_IMAGE environment variable to that name to make that image the default.

Additional supported base images will continue to be added. If you wish to build your own base image, please use the [Dockerfile in this repo](./autograder_sandbox/docker-image-setup/Dockerfile) as a starting point.

### Environment Variables
These variables can be used to override the default values of certain AutograderSandbox constructor parameters. In particular, we recommend setting `SANDBOX_MEM_LIMIT` to a value appropriate for your hardware.

`SANDBOX_DOCKER_IMAGE`: The default docker image to use for new sandbox instances.\
`SANDBOX_MEM_LIMIT`: The default container-level physical memory limit. Defaults to "4g" (4GB). See https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#memory for allowed values.\
`SANDBOX_PIDS_LIMIT`: The default container-level process spawn limit. Defaults to 512.

## Basic usage
```
from autograder_sandbox import AutograderSandbox

with AutograderSandbox() as sandbox:
    result = sandbox.run_command(['echo', 'hello world'], timeout=10)
    print(result.stdout.read().decode())
```

### Changelog
Versioning scheme:
- 0.0.x releases contain minor tweaks or bug fixes.
- 0.x.0 releases contain new features.
- x.0.0 releases may contain backwards-incompatible changes.

5.0.0 - Backwards-incompatible change to process spawn limit.
- Issues fixed:
    - [#41](https://github.com/eecs-autograder/autograder-sandbox/issues/41)
        - Removed the ability to place a specific nproc ulimit on commands.
          Instead, there is now a "block_process_spawn" option that sets the limit to 0 for the command. This let us remove the various hacks that we were using to work around the problem of "same UID in different containers, processes count towards same limit."
          See also https://github.com/eecs-autograder/autograder-sandbox/pull/46
    - [#43](https://github.com/eecs-autograder/autograder-sandbox/issues/43)
        - Added mypy to the CI toolchain and added py.typed in order to make type annotations usable externally.
- Other changes:
    - Lowered the default container-level memory limit to 4GB.

4.0.2 - Bug fix involving computing output size of TemporaryFile vs NamedTemporaryFile.

4.0.1 - Container-level process limits
- See https://github.com/eecs-autograder/autograder-sandbox/projects/2 for a full list of issues fixed.
- Significant changes:
    - Added container-level memory and process limits using Docker's cgroup options.
    - cmd_runner.py no longer has to be baked into images.

3.1.2 - Stdin /dev/null and Ubuntu version lock
- Issues fixed:
    - [#20](https://github.com/eecs-autograder/autograder-sandbox/issues/20)
- In autograder-sandbox/autograder_sandbox/docker-image-setup/Dockerfile, locked Ubuntu version to Xenial instead of using latest.

3.1.0 - Output truncating
- Issues fixed:
    - [#13](https://github.com/eecs280staff/autograder-sandbox/issues/13)
    - [#14](https://github.com/eecs280staff/autograder-sandbox/issues/14)
- Changes to `run_command` function:
    - Added optional `truncate_stdout` and `truncate_stderr` parameters that specify the maximum length of stdout and stderr to return in the command result.

3.0.0 - Better handling of large IO
- Issues fixed:
    - [#12](https://github.com/eecs280staff/autograder-sandbox/issues/12)
- Changes to `run_command` function:
    - `input` is now called `stdin` and takes in a file object.
    - The return value is now a `CompletedCommand`
    - `TimeoutExpired` is not raised on command timeout. Instead, `CompletedCommand` has a `timed_out` attribute.
    - The `stdout` and `stderr` fields of `CompletedCommand` are file objects.

2.1.0 - Permissions for files added to sandbox
- Issues fixed:
    - [#10](https://github.com/eecs280staff/autograder-sandbox/issues/10)
        - Added two arguments to the `add_files` function: `owner` and `read_only`.
          This gives the user the option to decide whether files added to the sandbox should be owned by
          'autograder' or 'root' and whether the files should be read-only.

2.0.1 - Hotfix for output decoding issue.
- Previously, stdout and stderr were not being decoded on TimeoutExpired or CalledProcessError. This release fixes this.

2.0.0 - Removes support for versions of Python < 3.5
- Issues fixed:
    - [#4](/james-perretta/autograder-sandbox/issues/4)
    - [#5](/james-perretta/autograder-sandbox/issues/5)
    - [#6](/james-perretta/autograder-sandbox/issues/6)
- Changes to AutograderSandbox constructor parameters:
    - Added `docker_image` and `container_create_timeout`
- Changes to AutograderSandbox.run_command() parameters:
    - Added `encoding` and `errors`
    - Renamed `input_content` to `input`
    - Renamed `raise_on_failure` to `check`
- AutograderSandbox.run_command() now returns subprocess.CompletedProcess. The `stdout` and `stderr` fields of the returned objects will always be strings.
- AutograderSandbox.run_command() now raises subprocess.TimeoutExpired if the time limit is exceeded. There is no longer a `timed_out` field of the returned object.

1.0.0 - Initial release
